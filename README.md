# Student Center Installation
### LAST UPDATED: Spring 2021
## Project Background 
### The Flyer Time Capsule is an interactive art display that also serves as a time capsule for the university.
### The idea is to get students more involved with the university by participating in an event hosted by the Office of Mission and Identity and/or the Cornerstone class (formerly Intro to College Experience) that introduces the time capsule and students will then add in their data. 
### The display will work with 40-60 3D modeled multicolored acrylic paper planes that will be installed in the big window of the Student Center and stage lights that are connected to a DMX light board. The installation also involves a Web Application as well as an Android application that will only run on a single Android tablet kiosk in the Student Center where students can add, edit, or delete data either remotely from the Web Application or in the Student Center using the kiosk. Student's data is then stored and recalled from a MySQL database. 
## What's Completed
### Mock-ups for the Web and Android Application
### The Database to store user data
## What's Currently Being Worked On
### Building and Prototying the 3D Modeled Paper Planes
## What We Still Need
### Front-End Development of the Web Application
### Front-End Development of the Android Application for the Kiosk
### Back-End Development of the Web Application
### Back-End Development of the Android Application for the Kiosk
### Database integration with both the Web Application and the Android kiosk Application
## Possible Add Ons for Future Classes
### Integrate lighting controls on the Android kiosk Application only (preventing the possiblilty of someone remotely controlling the lights)
### Integration with the LewisU mobile Application for students to access outside of a browser
